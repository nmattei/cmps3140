## Worload and Learning Time

**Note:** This is an upper division computer science course, *it is hard*, there will be a lot of work.  
* You will sometimes have multiple assignments at a time and be responsible for managing the deadlines.  Expect to spend 4-6 hours per week **outside of class** on this course ([Tulane policy is 1-2 hours per hour in class](https://catalog.tulane.edu/)).  
* In order to meet accreditation standards we have over 135 hours of documented learning time this semester.  The following is a rough breakdown of how long you should expect to work on the various types of assignments this semester:  
  * 27 Lectures (1h each), additional readings, review, small assignments (30 mins per lecture).
  * Homeworks will generally be 2 hours of work (8x)
  * Projects will be 10-15 hours of work each (6x)
  * Midterm and Final + Study (2x 5h+1h)
  * **Total:** 140 Hours.


For all assignments in this course please have a read over [Aire's Handy Coding Guide](./_projects/codingguide.md). For all code you hand in for this course we expect you to follow these best practices -- if you don't, you'll lose *Professionalism* points.  We're not being mean, just trying to get you ready for coding with other people.
